# Prerequisites

- Debian 12 base system

- python3.11 openssh-server

- Being able to SSH as root to the destination host

# Outcome

This will setup your Debian host to automatically run StepMania on boot. As soon as StepMania is closed, it will re-run it.

The "stepmania" user will be available to connect over SCP to push files
